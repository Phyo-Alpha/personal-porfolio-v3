                My journey with web development started during my university years where I was learning about data processing and analysis. During one of the projects, I contributed to a cinema application website where I used Django and HTML templates to build the app. This is where I discovered the joy of creating websites and as such shifted my career interest from data analysis to web development.

                That interest further developed when I discovered this amazing YouTube channel called Javascript Mastery. What separates that channel from the rest of the online tutorials is that it is project-focused learning. So I was learning about coding practices, popular libraries, and technologies in the web industry such as React and Next.js, while at the same time having fun building websites.
